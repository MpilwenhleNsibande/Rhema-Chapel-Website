  const fullText = `The story of Rhema Chapel International Churches, Republic of South Africa, is a typical reflection of the account of the Church in the Acts of the Apostles: “…and they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved… and so mightily grew the word of God and prevailed” (Acts 2:46-47; 19:20). From two believers coming together on September 20th in a shared apartment in Sunnyside, Pretoria, for a Bible study, we have grown into a family church and a weekly gathering of saints who come from different nations of African descent with a central mandate to take the word of God to the nations of the world while emphasizing its integrity. We aim to establish more satellite churches in cities, townships, and campuses of institutions of higher learning throughout the SADC region. Our church's core values have shaped who we are and the difference God has called us to make in a multi-racial community and culture, as seen in South Africa. In our ministry approach, we desire to see every believer come to their full potential and calling in Christ within an atmosphere that emphasizes the peoplehood of God. He said we are His people, and He is our God. To achieve this, our primary focus is on the Word of God, worship, training, family, outreach, and ministry are brought to the forefront in enriching the men and women of God from the very inception of their journey of faith to maturity. Following the pattern of the New Testament Church, we aspire to see Jesus lifted high and ministry gifts developed to disciple the nations of the world in line with the Great Commission through the enablement of the Holy Spirit. Through our various classes and curricula, which are tailor-made to fit both the inexperienced seeker and the already established believer who is hungry for more, the individual Christian's depth in Christ is nourished so that they rise from initial thirst and dryness to overflowing and becoming a river that satisfies our neighborhood. Rhema Chapel International Churches (an arm of the Ever-Increasing Word Ministries), as the home of blessed people, is a place for the aged and the young, families and singles, the fun-loving and the conservative. Our team of energetic workers does everything possible to ensure that you feel at home. We are small enough to minister to you yet large enough to welcome you.`;
